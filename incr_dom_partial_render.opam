synopsis: "A library for simplifying rendering of large amounts of data"
description: "
This library provides tools for rendering of tabular data efficiently, in particular supporting _partial rendering_, i.e. only rendering a subset of the widgets that are logically in the view, depending on what is expected to be visible to the end user.
